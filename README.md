Opposing Data Visualizations

Website: https://lindbergryan04.github.io/opposing-data-vis/

This project demonstrates how visual design can shape political perception using the same abortion access dataset to argue both for and against the claim that access is uneven across states.

For the Proposition
Metric: Travel gap (where care occurs vs. where patients live)

Redâ€“blue diverging scale and emotionally charged title

Highlights real disparities in access

Against the Proposition
Metric: Percent of in-state abortion care

Calm, capped color scale and neutral title

Downplays variation while keeping data accurate

Takeaway
Even truthful data can mislead through framing. This project reveals how subtle design choices can shift perception without changing a single number.
