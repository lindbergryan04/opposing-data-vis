        Persuasive or Deceptive Visualization?

      <h2>Proposition: Abortion access is not evenly distributed, and many patients are forced to leave their home state to seek care elsewhere.</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="/images/v1.png" alt="" />
          <figcaption>Abortion patients are often forced to travel across state lines to access care, revealing major gaps in local abortion availability.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Used the travel gap metric (No. of abortions by state of occurrence - No. of abortions by state of residence) to highlight real differences between need and availability of services.</li>
          <li>Applied a red-blue diverging color scale where red signals outflow (negative) and blue signals inflow (positive), creating an immediate, intuitive emotional map of access burdens.</li>
          <li>Selected the emotionally charged title "When Local Access Fails" to frame the visualization in a way that spotlights the real consequences of restrictive policies, helping viewers connect emotionally.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="/images/v2.png" alt="" />
          <figcaption>While some travel occurs, most abortion care is still delivered locally within patients' home states.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Depicted Percent Abortion Care in State (abortions by occurrence / abortions by residence × 100) to emphasize that most care happens in-state, downplaying absolute gaps.</li>
          <li>Capped values at 100% to visually flatten variation; states with major inflow don't visually dominate the map, masking true disparities.</li>
          <li>Used a calm, continuous color gradient and a neutral, reassuring title ("Abortion Access Remains Largely Local") to make differences harder to notice, subtly implying access is fine without lying.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>In this project, I had to make use of small but powerful design choices that subtly shape the perception of the viewer, while presenting technically accurate data. For the truthful visualization, I honored the real hardships many people face by choosing metrics and colors that made disparities immediately visible and emotionally resonant. Every design choice, from the diverging color scheme to the emotionally weighted title, was intended to make the current state of abortion injustice in the United States apparent to the viewer. <br>
          For the deceptive visualization, it was surprisingly easy to implement small design decisions that soften and obscure the truth without altering the underlying data. By using calm colors, a continuous color scheme, a capped scale, and a reassuring title, I was able to make serious structural issues seem almost nonexistent. The ethical implications of these choices are crucial to consider as a data scientist. Visualizations carry immense persuasive power, and it’s dangerously easy to betray a viewer’s trust if you are not deliberate with every design decision. <br>
          As data scientists, we owe it to the people who trust our work to present data honestly, because at times, the way you frame the numbers can shape reality even more than the numbers themselves. Working on this project made me realize just how easy it is to twist perception with small design choices, even when the underlying data never changes.
